# Rick and Morty Character Table

This project integrates the [Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/) to display a comprehensive table of characters from the iconic TV show *Rick and Morty*. It provides functionalities for filtering, sorting, pagination, and viewing detailed information about each character.

## Features

- **Character Table**: Displays a dynamic table of characters with filtering options for name, status, species, and gender.
- **Pagination**: Handles pagination to manage a dataset of at least 250 characters, ensuring efficient browsing.
- **Character Details**: Click on any character row to view detailed information about the selected character, including status, species, gender, and more.
- **Multiple Filters**: Allows multiple filters to be applied simultaneously, offering users a more customized search experience.
- **Clear Filters**: Resets all filters with a single click to help users start a new search.
- **No Results Message**: If no characters match the applied filters, a friendly message informs the user that no results were found.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive layout that works well on different screen sizes, from mobile phones to desktops.
